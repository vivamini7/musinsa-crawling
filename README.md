# musinsa-crawling

1. You have to install chromedriver and selenium first.
   
2. And you have to change local location which store the download image both goodimage-crawling.ipynb and snapshot-crawling.ipynb.
 
3. Lastly if you want to more crawling image in snapshot or good you have to change max_downloads code in def crwal_images.

4. If you want to change seasons, genders, styles, categories and anything else you have to change def main list.
   
DONE! Thanks a lot!
